# Two_Dice_Game
This is a program typed in standard Java language: This program runs in the Command Prompt. The program will generate two random numbers between 1 and 6 (representing the 6 sides of a die). One vale is for the player and one value is for the CPU. The object of the game is to "roll" a number higher than the CPU. Good Luck!
